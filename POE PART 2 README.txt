Once you runn the software a menu will pop up with 7 options; 
1 to enter recipes you wish to store, 
2 to view the list of recipes and ingredient information that you have stored , 
3 scale the quantity of the ingredients, 
5 to reset the amount of scaled quantities,
6 to delete the recipe entries and their details and finally 
7 to deleted all the entered information

once you have stored your first recipe, the app will take you back to the menu and only after you press option 1 will you be able to store another recipe as many times as you wish. 

user has to select option 1 as many times as they want in order to add as many recipes as they want
